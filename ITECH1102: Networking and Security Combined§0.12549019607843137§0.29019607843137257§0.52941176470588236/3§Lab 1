**10Base2**

- Ethernet (IEE 802.3) standard
- Used for LANs
- maximum 185m
- connects with BNC connectors
- runs at 10Mbps

**NAS**

- Network attached storage
- a server that does nothing but share files
- does not provide services like email, authentication, or file management
- allows more hard disk space on a network without shutting down servers
- can exist anywhere on a LAN and can be made of multiple NAS devices

**Cat-5 Cabling**

- short for Category 5 network cabling
- four twisted pairs of copper wire terminated by RJ45 connectors
- Supports frequencies of up to 100 MHz and speeds of up to  100MBps.
- can be used for ATM, token ring, 1000Base-T, 100Base-T and 10Base-T networking.
- LANs use cat 5 cabling.
- based on EIA, tia 568 commercial building telecommunications standard

**Distributed processing**

- computer systems that use more than one computer
- includes parallel processing where a single uses more than one CPU to execute programs
- typically on a lan for one program to run in multiple sites
- uses software to detect idle cpus for utilization
- may include distributed databases where data is stored across multiple computer systems

**Peer to Peer Networking**

- abbreviated to P2P
- a network in which each workstation has equivalent capabilities and responsibilityes
- different to client-server architectures where some servers serve others
- peer to peer networks are simpler but do not offer good performance under load
