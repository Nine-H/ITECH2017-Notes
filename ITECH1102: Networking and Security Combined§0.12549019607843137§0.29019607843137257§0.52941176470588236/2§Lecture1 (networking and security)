#Lecture1 (networking and security)

###what is computer networking?
- a telecommunications network that allows computers ot exchange data
- an engineering discipline that aims to study and analys the communication process among devices and systems that are linked to share data and resources
- any device that connects and generates data is a computer
- internet of things: tiny devices that communicate only with machines
- sensor driven parameters for AC, washing machines, car calling home

###types of data exchange
- google search
- netflix: video stream
- audio streaming: pandora, rhapsody, spotify
- sending files to a printer
- email
- skype: real time video chat
- uploading files to dropbox or onedrive
- phonecalls on viber: voip
- ebay

###data exchange on eBay
- view tiems on ebay
- select item for purchase and go to checkout
- login to ebay (authentication security)
- pay with paypal (encryption security)

###tech on eBay
- site hosted in USA
- made purchase from home using desktop computer
- desktop connects to network using cat6 cable

###cat6 cables
- 4pairs of twisted wire
- twists per distance must be correct: crosstalk
- specific wires connected to speicific pins: standards
- but we don't care, that's for standards orgs.

###WiFi
- whole new set of technologies to use and understand
- home network WiFi router
- 2.4 - 5ghz band

###Mobile phone data
- mobile base station
- 800 - 1900 Khz band

###devices in ebay exchange
- home pc
- ebay server
- communications netowrk
- paypal server
- bank server

###tools
- wireshark: industry standard protocol analyser and network sniffer
- virtualisation tools: simulate a pc on your pc

###numbers systems
system|numerals|base|locational significance
--|--|--|--
decimal | [0-9] | base10 | ..., 10^2 (100), 10^1 (10), 10^0 (1)
binary | [0,1] | base2 |  ..., 2^2 (4), 2^1 (2), 2^0 (1)
octal | [0-7] | base 8 | ...,
hexadecimal | [0-f] | base16 | ..., 16^2 (256), 16^1 (16), 16^0 (1)

**locational significance**

what the number in each column is multiplied by. determined by the base of the number system.

**binary**

rightmost bit is the least significant bit, must include leading zero bits, the leftmost bit is the most significant bit. (this is big-endian, there also exist little endian systems that store the least significant bit first).

**hexadecimal and octal**

octal numbers or base 8 can be represented by 3 bits. conversion can be done by grouping the raw binary into 3-bit numbers.

hexadecimal can be represented with 4 bits. conversion is done by grouping raw binary into 4-bit numbers and calculating the value from 0-F (or 0-15). Hex is used in MAC addresses. You denote a hex number with a subscript 16 EG 134<sub>16</sub>.

for an n-bit number system the minimum is 0 and the maximum is 2^n -1, and the total amount of numbers is 2^n. for example a 5-bit number system would have a maximum of 2^5 - 1 = 31 and can represent 32 different values.

**decimal to binary**

the process for converting 37 to binary:

step | subtract | remainder | bit
--|--|--|--
0 | 37 - 32 | 5 | 1
1 | 5 - 16 | -11 | 0
2 | 5 - 8 | -3 | 0
3 | 5 - 4 | 1 | 1
4 | 1 - 2 | -1 | 0
5 | 1 - 1 | 0  | 1
