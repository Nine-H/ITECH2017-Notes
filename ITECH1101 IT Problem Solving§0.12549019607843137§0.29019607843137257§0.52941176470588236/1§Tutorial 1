###Importance of problem solving
> "Regardless of profession we are all hired to do the same job: solve problems" -Martin Yate

###Mindset
- define what success is to you
- deal with failures
- find the discipline to do the work

> "I have not failed 10,000 times, I have not failed once. I have succeeded in proving those 10,000 ways do not work. When I have eliminated the ways that won't work I will find the way that does" -- Thomas Edison

**When you have failures**

- I'm not good at this: practice
- It's embarrassing to make mistakes: everyone does
- I can't do it: probably can
- People will think I'm stupid/dumb/failure: fuck'em they're probably to self absorbed to notice you
- I'm not smart enough: nobody is until they aren't

**fixed mindset**

- believe that abilities are inherent
- afraid of being judged
- like certainty

**growth mindset**

- believe abilities are aquired
- respond to feedback
- enjoy challenges
