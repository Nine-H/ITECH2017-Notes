Mit's Human Dynamics laboratory.

look for the "It factor" (teams that click)

Creepy badges that record 100 data points/minute, which have been deployed in 21 organisations over seven years

identifying characteristics:
people that talk
facing one another while talking
connecting directly
back-channeling and side conversations
periodically taking breaks, going outside the team and bringing data back

energy ENERGY engagement and exploration

application
visualisation
training
fine tuning

office space, seating, making staffing changes, giving feedback

**finished abstract**

The MIT Human Dynamics Laboratory extensively studied effective teams in an attempt to pin down what they termed the "it" factor. They did this by using wireless smart badges that recorded over 100 data points every minute. Using this data tey identified five characteristics of strong teams: talking, facing each other, connecting without managerial oversight, back channeling, and finding outside information for teammates. they used this data to visualise problems, train staff and fine tune solutions. They published a study that details changes for office space and seating and suggest swapping staff members through teams and giving feedback until a strong team is developed.

made slack, for im worth 540m

useful for teams: channels, real-time, casual

efficency, file sharing, 800,000 users

75m annual revenue

automation and bots: analytics, progress reports

**finished abstract**

Stewart Butterfield has worked for many businesses, he is the current boss of slack. He made flickr and sold it for 35m in 2005. He wrote slack originally as an internal messaging tool for his games company. His team foud it valuable because it worked in real time, as a casual conversation, sorted discussion into channels instead of email chains, and failitated file sharing and having bots participate, producing analytics and progress reports as part of the conversation. Using slack internally he grew the project into a platform with 800,000 users and $75m annual revenue.
