#Lecture1

###What is digital?
computers and whatnot

###The Big Idea
- What digital technology means
- Transformations in the past and future

###Course Goals
- Cover the fundamentals of IT
- Introduce Business Information Systems
- Put IT in the context of broader society
- Understand IT as the intersection of tech and humanity

>Investigate how **amazing**, **interesting**, **trasformative**, and sometimes **scary** computers can be

###Resources
- Moodle
- No textbook
- Merrit, Bob and ProQuest (2016) The Digital revoluion - Synthesis Lectures on Emerging Engineering Technologies
- Student Email, need to check

###Assessment
- Create a video about an IT topic (15%)
- Write a proposal to disrupt an existing industry or domain (25%)
- The outcomes of the first 10 lab tasks (10%)
- Exam (50%)
- **Assignments Wk5**

###Revolutions
Our world has been transformed by a long series of evolutions and revolutions, revolutions are quicker

Examples include the industrial revolution and the exponential growth of the internet.

###Enough electronics to be dangerous

***electrical signals are the building blocks of computers***

- transistors
- boolean logic
- representation of numbers: base10, base2, hexadecimal
- physics of computing

###Hardware and software

**How people make computers do the stuff they want them to do**

- how CPU's operate: cram shit in the registers and increment the clock
- what algorithms are: recipie for results
- how people make computers do interesting things
- storing information

###Connecting people and computers

**computer systems are useful if they communicate**

- networking and the internet
- process modelling
- computer graphics
- user interfaces
- ubiquitous computing: everywhere!

###Emergent technologies
- Artificial Intelligence
- Virtual Reality: the million dollar industry to make a fake reality that's blocky and gives you a headache
- Something different and cool each week

###Social impact of the digital revolution
- Ethics and some ethical theories
- How each technology affects society

###Weekly structure
- the past
- the present
- the future

###Digital Revolution
- develompent: more powerful
- commoditization: cheaper

**Technical Drivers**

- Speed: fast getting faster
- Price: cheap getting cheaper
- Size: small getting smaller

>The capacity to process information at high speeds allows us to solve entire classess of problems that were previously impractical or impossible.

Name | Price | GFLOPS | CBA
-- | -- | -- | --
Cray-2 | $30M | 1.9 GFLOPS | $16M / GFLOP
PS4 | $500 | 135GFLOPS CPU 4197GFLOPS GPU | 11c/GFLOP

**Price**

- Mass Production: making more
- Competition and Globalization
- Improved manufacturing processes and miniturization

**Moore's Law**

- Gordon Moore
> the complexity of integrated circuits doubles every year
- logarithmic scale

**Speed**
- Higer speed
- Less heat
- Lower cost
- New applications

###Digital Revolution - What's changed
Has anybody bought an actual newspaper n the last year?

>New media types challenge established norms

Have you recently had a discussion about who was in a movie and the outcome was " I guess we'll never know"

>Easy access to information changes how we approach problems

- instant global communication
- eCommerce
- smart phones
- online games
- digital images and video

**What hasn't changed?**

People are fundamentally the same as we were 100 years ago.

- printing press lead to copyright laws
- automobiles lead to road laws
- DVD's led to the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act)

**Lawrence Lessig: founder of Creative Commons movement**

Four types of constraint regulate any human activity

- Law: laws and their enforcement
- Social: norms, morals, and ethical constraints
- Economic: what can I afford? (speeding v. tyres, fuel)
- Natural Barriers: physical limitations

Constraints support each other: Criminality is socially and legally unacceptable
Constraints antagonise each other: Piracy is Cheap and arguably easy

See also: Stanford Law and the Microsoft v. Apple _Look and Feel_ case

Internet regulations
- Law: Weak National jurisdictions for a global technology
- Social: internet is new and there are few social norms
- 2fast5me
- Economic 

###Ethics

Legal Economic and Natural constraints determine whether you **can** do something

Social constraints determine whether you should.

>The principles of right and wrong that guide behaviour or activity
>The philosopy of morality

**In Practice**
- beliefs
- social conventions
- rules
- assumptions

**IT creates ethical challenges**
- a software tester discovers a software fault that her supervisor does not report
- sysadmin accidentally discovers illegal activity in someone's email
- a developer is asked to implement a s feature that will discriminate against a group of people

> ethical dillemmas do not have easy solutions

**Trolly Problem**
- do nothing and implicitly kill five
- pull the lever and explicitly kill one
- there is only one acceptable answer
- multi track dorifto

**Hospital waiting room**
- six patients
- five need organs
- one needs nothing
- kill one to save five
- do nothing and five die
- order the harvesting
- 40% of your fellow students are communists

**Comparitively**
- did you answer differently
- what was different?
- how would you respond if hte numbers were different?
- what if the person was part of your family?

**How do we determine what is ethical?**

- underpins the entire field of ethics
- many attempts
- focus on applied ethics
- the code of conduct

an example of a code of conduct would be the ten commandments, the five precepts of buddhism.

**ACS**
Asustralian Computer Society
peak professional industry body for IT and CS

- Primacy of Public Interest
- Enhancement of Quality of Life
- Honesty
- Competence
- Professional Development
- Professionalism

**Limitations of Codes of Conduct**

>You will **confront attempt to limit diversity** in the workplace, and ensure that opportunities for employment, advancement, remuneration, and other working conditions are based on the **actual skills and performance of employees**, free of stereotypes and prejudices.

Should you employ a less qualified employee to maintain diversity?

###Ethical Frameworks

- Deontology: Duty based ethics, rules, frameworks.
- Utilitarianism: Consequence based ethics, maximizing happiness
- Virtue Ethics: being a good person is the way to ethical behaviour, positive character traits, honesty, competence, professionalism

**aristotle's list of moral virtues**

**Whistleblowing**
- is it OK for an IT professional to leak information?
- Wikileaks
- Snowden
- Lecture notes

**Whistleblowing - Deontology**

following the ACS Code of ethics this may fall under the Primacy of Public Interest
>you will place the interests of the public above those of personal, business, or sectional interests

**Whistleblowing - Utilitarianism**

- reduce surveilance
- improve the lives of targets
- what about gov workers?
- if nothing is done then everybody just becomes unhappy with the government

**Whistleblowing - Virtues**
- Courage: taking the risk
- Temperance: accepting blackballing
- Truthfulness: telling the truth
- Righteous indignation: it's not the role of private companies to reimplement the STASI

Identify which of these three ethical frameworks aligns with how you htink about ethical behaviour
- what makes this framework appealing?
